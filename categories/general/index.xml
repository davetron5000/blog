      <title>Blogging and the Paralysis of Choice</title>

      <description>When I talk to younger developers about starting to blog, they often say things like &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to write about&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I have nothing to say&amp;rdquo;. This is because there is simply a paradox of too much to say, or what is commonly referred to as paralysis of choice. The field of software engineering is a complex one, full of detail. Trying to encompass all that detail can be terrifying.</description>

      <title>Bill Gates</title>

      <description>Some back of the envelope numbers I was pondering this morning:
40 hours / week * 50 weeks / year = 2000 hr / yr
Bill Gates is worth about $66 billion. He&amp;rsquo;s worked for about 33 years now.
66 billion / 33 years = $2 billion/year / 2000 = $1 million / hour.
Bill Gates has made roughly $1 million per hour over the length of his career. Most people would be happy to make that amount in a decade.</description>

      <title>Sexism and Programming</title>
      <link>https://www.mikeperham.com/2012/10/14/sexism-and-programming/</link>

      <description>In my experience, sexism is not overt in the software world. I do think there is an unspoken bias against anyone who is not a white male. For all the talk of egalitarianism in Silicon Valley, this is my belief:
White men have to prove their incompetence. Everyone else has to prove their competence.
This is why I think it is important to support organizations like RailsGirls looking to educate and improve the engineering skills of those minority groups.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged much for the last year because most of my technical blogging went to the Carbon Five blog. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to Portland and have a new job at TheClymb I&amp;rsquo;ll be returning my attention to my own blog so expect new content regularly again!</description>

      <description>I got 1.5MB/sec downloads while waiting for my flight home at the Charlotte airport. And trust me, that was not burst but sustained. Free T1-speed Internet access? Holy cow!</description>

      <description>Am I the only one who laughs when I do a Google search for &amp;ldquo;Merb&amp;rdquo;? I mean I know Ruby guys are usually pretty nerdy. What is Google trying to tell us? :-)</description>
