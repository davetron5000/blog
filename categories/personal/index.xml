      <title>My Next Chapter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 2.5 years I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move on from The Clymb. I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly proud of our accomplishments during my time there: the site has dramatically increased in stability and scalability, the GitHub development workflow really improved code quality and we increased the size of the development team from 3 to 15. On the technical side, we moved from manually-configured cloud-based servers to Chef-managed dedicated servers, switched email providers twice, moved warehouses and rewrote our inventory and fulfillment process, integrated our logistics and fulfillment processes with an ERP system, and much more. I&amp;rsquo;m really proud to have helped grow the business while they helped me grow in management skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I doing next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>One Great Year at The Clymb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theclymb.com/invite-from/mperham&#34;&gt;The Clymb&lt;/a&gt; one year ago today and what an amazing year it&amp;rsquo;s been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context for you: I was employee 33 and the third engineer to join. The test suite had hundreds of failures and had been running red for months. We were on REE, Rails 2.3 and Delayed Job &amp;ndash; a stack that was current two years before &amp;ndash; and had no error service to know what errors were happening in production. The site was deployed with fabric, a Python-based tool. The first two developers were overworked and fought fires all day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged much for the last year because most of my technical blogging went to the Carbon Five blog. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to Portland and have a new job at TheClymb I&amp;rsquo;ll be returning my attention to my own blog so expect new content regularly again!</description>

      <description>Good news, everybody â€” I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new job in 2011! I&amp;rsquo;ve accepted a position at Carbon Five. While I enjoyed the challenges of starting a new business, I found the 60+ hr work weeks just unmaintainable with a new baby in the house. Carbon Five presents me many of the same challenges of Bootspring (e.g. finding new clients, recruiting new developers, designing and developing great code for victory) without the tedious bits (e.</description>

      <title>Risk and Startups</title>
      <link>https://www.mikeperham.com/2010/04/20/risk-and-startups/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at 7-8 startups in the last 12 years, learning along the way that I love the freedom and flexibility that a small company affords. You pay a good price for that freedom though in the form of risk: your job will be measured in terms of months and years, not decades. My parents spent decades at their jobs working for large corporations; that kind of job security does not exist at a startup.</description>

      <title>How I Achieved my Dream with the iPhone</title>
      <link>https://www.mikeperham.com/2009/01/15/dreams-and-the-iphone/</link>

      <description>This article spurred me in a completely unexpected technical direction over the winter break: Massive Christmas iPod Touch Sales Boost App Store Downloads. Two facts struck me:
An application which makes farting sounds was selling 40,000 units/day. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a secret dream for a year&amp;hellip; My dream? To make a $5 keychain sold at the checkout stand in Wal-Mart which just plays gag sound effects. The keychain&amp;rsquo;s user interface is dead simple: three buttons, each of which plays a sound.</description>
