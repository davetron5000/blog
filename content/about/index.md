I'm an independent open source software developer based in Portland, OR where I live with a beautiful wife and energetic little boy.

I've been writing software since 1993 and open source since 1995.

Today I'm the founder and CEO of [Contributed Systems][1], my own company dedicated to building and supporting open-source-based application infrastructure.

In my free time I spend most of my time advocating for a greener, more just society.
My passion is micromobility and its potential to transform our ugly, car-dependent cities.
I volunteer at organizations like [losn.org][2] and [fb4k.org][3].
