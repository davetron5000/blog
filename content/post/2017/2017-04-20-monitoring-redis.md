Redis is widely used by the Ruby community but, like any complex piece of
infrastructure, isn't well understood by many of its users.  I wanted to
write a blog post that would answer the question: **How can I check on
the health of my Redis server?**  Here's a few things you can do to
better understand your Redis server.

----
## Ask for Info

The `info` command is the easiest way to get an overall view of Redis:

```
$ redis-cli info

(output trimmed a bit)

There's a few very important pieces to note in the output:

1. `config_file` shows where Redis is getting its static configuration.
   If you need to tweak a setting, this is where to go.
1. `connected_clients` shows how many network client connections are
   currently connected.  It's normal for this to be in the hundreds or
   even thousands for a very busy server.
1. `used_memory_*` is important to see how much RAM is used by Redis.

Memory is the most important thing to note here.  Your entire dataset
size **must** fit into machine RAM.  If it does not, the resulting swapping will lead
to terrible performance and massive latency spikes.

`redis-cli --stat` will give you the most important details in a real-time view
you can watch or scrape:

```
$ redis-cli --stat
------- data ------ --------------------- load -------------------- - child -
keys       mem      clients blocked requests            connections
31         1009.00K 1       0       681483 (+0)         576
31         1009.00K 1       0       681484 (+1)         576
31         1009.00K 1       0       681485 (+1)         576
```

`redis-cli` is a very powerful tool with lots of nice features within
it.  It's worth running `--help` and playing with the various options
and modes.

## Look out for Latency

Latency is the time difference between request and response, e.g. the client sends a
command and gets a result back in 10ms.  We want this round trip to be as fast as
possible.
Really bad latency can trigger "Operation timed out" exceptions in your application.
There are two general latency sources:

1. Network - the network between the client and Redis can be congested.
2. Internal - Redis itself might have commands or internal operations
   which add significant latency.

### Network

You can see the current network latency easily:

```
$ redis-cli --latency
min: 0, max: 1, avg: 0.29 (632 samples)
```

This shows a minimum of 0ms and max of 1ms, averaging 290Âµs, latency to
my localhost server.  Ideal conditions.

You can also easily watch latency history, here with a default window of 15 sec:

```
$ redis-cli --latency-history
min: 0, max: 7, avg: 0.24 (1321 samples) -- 15.00 seconds range
min: 0, max: 256, avg: 0.55 (1280 samples) -- 15.01 seconds range
min: 0, max: 3062, avg: 3.86 (1051 samples) -- 15.98 seconds range
min: 0, max: 490, avg: 0.69 (1255 samples) -- 15.01 seconds range
```

You can see the first window looks pretty good, the second window had a
spike of 256ms, and the third had a spike of 3062ms (ouch!).

I triggered these spikes by running `redis-cli debug sleep 0.5`.  Not
recommended in production.

### Internal

Redis also has a latency event and monitoring subsystem to track
commands execution latency and operations (like forking) which might
block command processing. Use the [LATENCY](https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor)
commands to monitor and collect these events.  Some commands can be naturally
slow, see SLOWLOG below.

----
## Watch for Slow Commands

Because it is single-threaded, it's vitally important that all commands
to Redis process quickly or one slow command can block everyone else for
a significant amount of time.  Redis includes a configurable [SLOWLOG](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog)
command to watch for these bad apples.

My Redis is configured by Homebrew to log any commands that take longer than 10ms, a
sensible default.  Run this on your instance and see if you find anything suspicious:

```
$ redis-cli slowlog get 10
1) 1) (integer) 3
   2) (integer) 1492461257
   3) (integer) 11825
   4)  1) "LPUSH"
       2) "queue:default"
       3) "{\"queue\":\"default\",\"jid\":\"df55c4e27c48e63f0d5212b4\",\"class\":\"LoadWorker\",\"args\":[0],\"created_at\":1492461257.208411,\"enqueued_at\"... (33 more bytes)"
       4) "{\"queue\":\"default\",\"jid\":\"4989e31cea7ecf78e93b7f9f\",\"class\":\"LoadWorker\",\"args\":[1],\"created_at\":1492461257.2084169,\"enqueued_at... (34 more bytes)"
      [snip]
      32) "... (9971 more arguments)"
```

There are four parts to each entry: 3 is a unique identifier, 1492461257 is the timestamp
when it happened and 11825 is the number of microseconds for execution, 11.825ms.
The last part is the command with arguments.

I happen to know that entry is an LPUSH to the `default` queue of 10,000 jobs.  It's
a testcase for Sidekiq::Client's `push_bulk` API.  Since we're
enqueueing 10,000 jobs at once, it's not surprising that might take almost 12ms.

**It is safe to run SLOWLOG in production and highly encouraged.**  In
fact, I would play with `slowlog-log-slower-than` values until you find
a setting that catches unexpectedly slow things but does not contain a
lot of "normal" commands from your application.
If you find the slowlog is constantly full, **redesign your system so it
doesn't run those slow commands**.
  For instance, if you want to enqueue
10,000 jobs, perhaps you could call `push_bulk` 10 times with 1000 jobs
each, so each invocation only takes 1/10th as long.
If a piece of OSS is running a slow comamnd,
open an issue so the maintainer knows about the problem.  I'm not too
proud to admit it's
[happened](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/3332)
several times with Sidekiq; I fix them as fast as I can!

## Extra Credit

When I was managing technical operations, my team was
responsible for monitoring our infrastructure.  We would do things like:

1. Write a cron job to dump the slowlog to a daily email if it is not empty.
  Treat any entries as issues to be investigated and fixed.
2. Set up a dashboard for the Redis server.  Have dedicated
   graphs for `connected_clients`, `instantaneous_ops_per_sec`, and `used_memory_rss`.
   Treat big changes in these graphs as incidents to be investigated.

Part of owning your infrastructure is monitoring its health proactively;
understanding these tools and having quick access to this data will be
invaluable when debugging failures and outages.
